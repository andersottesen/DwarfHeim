<p>When possible investors and other potential collaborators visit the site, they will find relevant information here. This will feature business related information, and technical notes. This site will comprise three parts. The first part will be professional information about the team, company structure, and history. Below that there will be a section dedicated to presenting the business plan and related information. At the bottom users will find a contact form for contacting the company about business related inquiries. This contact form will be the same as on the Contact-page, but it will send the information to a different address.
