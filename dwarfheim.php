            “DwarfHeim” is a real time strategy computer game where four players cooperate together to create a thriving dwarf society and survive a neverending horde of orc attacks.
            Each player chooses one of four classes, which all have their unique tasks and skills. The game focus on cooperation. Sharing limited resources makes teamwork an important skill needed to survive.
            If you use more than what is wise and only focus on your own tasks you’ll put the whole society in danger. It’s a game where you’ll learn to cooperate and put the dwarf city ahead of your own ambitions.
