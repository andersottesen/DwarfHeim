    <h1>P1 - Requirements</h1>
    <p>Date: 22.Sep 2015</p>
    <h2>Group members</h2>

    <p>Eirik Fosse, Lars Klingenberg, Madeleine Lorås, Kristoffer R. Andresen, Marian Aspås</p>

    <h2>Client</h2>

    <p><b>Client Name:</b> DwarfHeim<br/>
        <b>Contact Person:</b> Hans Kleven</p>

    <p>Our client is a Norwegian game development company, introduced by one of our team members; Eirik Fosse. The
        client is in the process of making a new real time pc strategy game called DwarfHeim, and wants a new website to
        promote their game, and to attract possible investors and collaborators. DwarfHeim will feature an innovative
        gameplay experience centered around cooperation and asymmetrical play styles, that are cartoony and based on
        humour.</p>

    <h2>Meeting with the client</h2>

    <p>On September 3rd we met three of the DwarHeim team members for a meeting about our potential creation of a
        website for them. We agreed quite quickly to do the project with them and spent the rest of the time discussing
        requirements and design. They told us about their game, how it will look, how they want it to feel and we
        discussed the constraints of our project. We arranged that they will provide conceptual art, FAQ and other
        information about the site and that they will come in and review our design document. </p>


    <h2>Purpose and Goals</h2>

    <p>The purpose of the website is to give gamers and investors information and news about DwarfHeim. This website
        will be a place where gamers can get updates and status about the game in development, and a place where
        investors can read about the team of developers and get in contact with them. The main purpose is to get the
        gamers interested in playing the game. By adding videos and concept art from the game to the web page gamers
        will get to know the game and hopefully be motivated to play it. Simultaneously this will show the investors
        what the game is about and get them interested in the development team. A secondary purpose of the website is to
        inform stakeholders (gamers and investors) about the development team. This will include a brief presentation of
        the team members and their position in the DwarfHeim project. The goal of the web page is that it should be easy
        to navigate and find relevant information for both gamers and investors. The site should also be minimalistic,
        which means that the web page should be should not be clean and bright, and no any disturbing elements.</p>

    <h2>Audience</h2>

    <p>The main target audience of this web page is meant to be potential gamers. We also aim at attracting potential
        investors. For the gamers we will present trailers, conceptual art and information about the game to get them
        interested and motivated to play the game. Investors on the other hand will want to find information about the
        developers, technical information, the business model and contact information. For both gamers and investors we
        will include interviews with all the team members so that the stakeholders can get to know the team better.</p>

    <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Since we are planning to use videos and images the website might load slowly.</li>
        <li>Since we are running the website on a web-server, we can meet some challenges concerning getting everything
            to run as planned.
        </li>
        <li> One of our goals is to make the site run on all types of devices, which means it has to be responsive and
            will acquire some work and
            testing.
