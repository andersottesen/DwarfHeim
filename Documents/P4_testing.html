    <h1>P4 - Testing</h1>
    <p>Date: 15.Nov 2015</p>
    <h2>Group members</h2>

    <p>Eirik Fosse, Lars Klingenberg, Madeleine Lorås, Kristoffer R. Andresen, Marian Aspås</p>

    <h2>Administrative Details </h2>

    <p><b>Client Name: </b>Dwarfheim</p>

    <p><b>Website Name: </b>Dwarfheim website</p>

    <p><b>Contact person:</b> Hans Kleven</p>

    <h2>Tester Audience</h2>

    <p>Our test audience consists of both potential gamers and our client. This audience will also be a part of the end user-group of the application.
        We tested on two students who play a lot of games. The web application was also tested by the client, during a meeting. We did not have access to
        any potential investors, so we were not able to test on them. </p>

    <h2>Testing Document</h2>

    <p>To test our site we decided to do a sit-down test with both potential gamers and the client. For potential gamers we wanted to test two things; the page layout and the feel of the page.
        To test the layout, we gave the users some small tasks, such that they could navigate through the web application. Afterwards we asked them some questions about the look and feel of the page.
        The questions we asked were:</p>

    <p><b>Test tasks:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Find Eirik Fosse's phone number</li>
        <li>Look at all the pictures</li>
        <li>Watch a video</li>
        <li>Read about the latest updates in the game</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>Follow-up questions:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>How would you describe the mood/feel of the page? (dark, happy, dramatic etc. )</li>
        <li>Do you want to play the game?</li>
        <li>What do you think about the balance between information and sale?</li>
    </ol>

    <br>
    <p>We also wanted some concrete answers and feedback from our client, and we asked them the following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Do you think the web page is logical? Do you have any problem with navigating through the web application?</li>
        <li>What do you think about the graphical design of the web page?</li>
        <li>What do you think about the web site's atmosphere, is it too dark?</li>
        <li>How is the balance between informational content and the marketing of the site?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Platforms</h2>

    <p>Both mobile devices and browsers on computers were used as testing platforms when we conducted the user tests.
        We tested the following browsers; Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer. This was to see how the GUI and layout turned out on the different devices. </p>


    <h2>Feedback Summary</h2>
    <h3>Potential gamers</h3>

    <p><b>Test person 1</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>"The landing-page is to big. There should not be a need to scroll. Also the logo should be a link."</li>
        <li>Finding the phone number was easy.</li>
        <li>Finding and looking through the pictures was no problem.</li>
        <li>Did not like that the heading-fonts were different from the navigationbar-fonts.</li>
        <li>Needed more time and information before he could say anything about wanting to play the game.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Test person 2</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Finding the phone number was easy.</li>
        <li>Navigated through “The game” to look at the pictures.</li>
        <li>Found the media-page, and this was easy.</li>
        <li>Did not have any problems with finding “the news”</li>
        <li>Navigated without problem to “the game”</li>
        <li>"The background is a bit boring". The test person wanted more patterns or more decorations on the background on the sides, or maybe another color.</li>
        <li>The test person though it was too much space between objects on the web site.</li>
        <li>"The header-picture is really cool! This sets the mood and atmosphere."</li>
        <li>Thought it was a lack of information on the site. Could have been more interesting with more content on the web site.
            "Like this site for instance: <a href="https://www.wow-one.com/">wow-one.com</a>"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Client</h3>
    <p>The customer was pleased with the site we showed them. They liked how the site looked, and that it wasn't too dark and serious, although the colours and sidebars were a bit boring.
        Navigating through the site was no problem, and they found all the information they were asked fairly quickly. One page they did not like that much was the page with information about the game (dwarfheim.php).
        The image should be bigger, and the layout of the information was not appealing enough. The interviews page on the other hand was really good, and they like how there is one page with every team member with contact info, and that each person has their own interview page.</p>

       <p> All in all they really like the page, and with some adjustments to the content they provided (text, images, etc.) they will soon host the site on their own server.</p>

    <h2>Our Response</h2>
    <p>The tests revealed that the lack of information on the page is a big problem, something we already knew.
        We did not receive more information from the client, most likely due to the fact that their project is newly started and that there just are not any information available at this time. This however, is easy to fix once the information exists.
        We implemented the minor changes that the test audience suggested right away. These are described in detail in out  <a href="P3_changes.html">changes document</a>.
        Since we were not supposed to do any huge changes after the testing, except for the eventual critical flaws, we chose not to implement the major changes, such as new graphics for the side-bars.</p>

    <p>We made an agreement with the customer that we will not make any changes to the site based on the test results we got from them.
        They will instead make the necessary changes in layout and colours themselves, before they publish it to their own server.
        This was favourable for both parties, since it gives them freedom to test different layouts and colours.</p>

    <h2>Self Reflection</h2>

    <p>In addition to learn the general structure and use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript,this project taught us that implementing a web application like this takes a lot of coordination and planning.
        It is a puzzle to make sure look and feel matches. Having a good and comprehensive design document is essential.
        Also spending time together as a team is important. When the team meets, problems that arises can be solved fast and new ideas can be incorporated in the site.</p>

    <p>We all felt it was challenging to create a proper web application without back-end. We had an actual client in need of a functional page, and it would have been nice to be able to complete it,
        and add other functionality that requires back-end.
        On the other hand, we realise that completing a functional web application with both front- and back-end would be a lot of work,
        and that the project then would become too extensive.</p>

    <p>We had a lot of fun to actually create a web application from scratch, and we enjoyed this project quite a lot.
        Hopefully our client will be able to use our project as a starting point to their own web sites.</p>
