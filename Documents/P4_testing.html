    <h3> Potential gamers</h3>

    <p>Testperson 1 </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The landingpage is to big. There shouldn’t be a need to scroll. Also the logo should be a link. </li>
        <li> Finding the phonenumber was easy. </li>
        <li> Finding and looking through the pictures was no problem.</li>
        <li> Did not like that the heading fonts were different from the navigationbar fonts.</li>
        <li> Needed more time and information before he could say anything about wanting to play the game. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Testperson 2 </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Finding the phonenumber was easy. </li>
        <li> Navigated through “The game” to look at the pictures.</li>
        <li> Found the media- page, and this was easy.</li>
        <li> Didn’t have any problems with finding “the news”</li>
        <li> Navigated without problem to “the game”</li>
        <li> Wanted more patterns or more decorations on the background, or maybe another color. The testperson found the background boring.</li>
        <li> The testperson though it was too much space between objects on the web site.</li>
        <li>  The header- picture was really cool, setting the mood and atmosphere.</li>
        <li>  Though it was a lack of information on the site. Could have been more interesting with more content on the web site. Example: wow-one.com</li>

    <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Since we are planning to use videos and images the website might load slowly.</li>
        <li>Since we are running the website on a web-server, we can meet some challenges concerning getting everything
            to run as planned.
        </li>
        <li> One of our goals is to make the site run on all types of devices, which means it has to be responsive and
            will acquire some work and
            testing.
        </li>
