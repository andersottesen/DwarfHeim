    <h2 id="purpose">Purpose, goals, and audience</h2>

    <p>The purpose of our website is to give gamers and investors information and news about the DwarfHeim game. This
        website will be a place where gamers can get updates and status about the game in development, and a place where
        investors can read about the team of developers and get in contact with them. The main purpose is to get the
        gamers interested in playing the game. A secondary purpose of the website is to inform stakeholders (gamers and
        investors) about the development team. </p>

    <h2 id="navigation">Navigation Structure</h2>

    <p>The webpage will mainly be structured as a clique, except for two pages. Every page connects to every other page,
        via the navigation bar located at the top of the page. The exceptions are the landing page and the interview
        pages. The landing page only comes up the first time you visit the page and will not be accessible from any
        other page. The landing page guides the visitor to the home page,where the rest of the clique is visible. The
        interview page will only be accessible via the page about the whole crew, and will show the navigation bar just
        like the other pages. </p>

    <p><b>Landing page - landingpage.php</b></p>

    <p>The visitors will be redirected to the landing page the first time they visit the website. The landing page will
        contain only a video and a link to the homepage. We will use cookies to keep track of whether they have visited
        the website before or not.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this page is eventually to show a game trailer or ingame gameplay (these videos does not exist
        yet).</p>

    <p>We will use Javascript to set a cookie for the user which we use to remember that the he visited the landing
        page.</p>

<div class="page">

    <p><b>Home page - homepage.php</b></p>

    <p>After getting a video presentation of DwarfHeim at the landing page, you will be directed to the Home page. Here
        we will present what you can find at DwarfHeim. This page is has a Two-column layout where Art Gallery and The
        Crew will be presented in one and information about Dwarfheim in the other column. </p>

    <p>The purpose of this page is to inspire the users to click further into the page and discover what DwarfHeim is
        all about. We will focus on less text and more images to not overwhelm the visitors. If the visitors want to
        read more, they can easy get to every other page just by one click by using the navigation bar. </p>

    <p>We will use Javascript to see if the visitor has been on this page before by fetching cookies. </p>

<div class="page">

    <p><b>Media - media.php</b></p>

    <p>On this page the DwarfHeim team can show their ideas and progression regarding the visual design of the game. The
        media page will contain a submenu with two items, Video and Images. </p>

    <p>The video subpage will contain all the videos of the game in a gallery. The videos will have description text and
        titles. When a video is selected it will pop up into a larger format. </p>

    <p>The image subpage will be very similar to the video page. Images will also have a title and description. When an
        image is selected it will pop up into a larger format. Small thumbnails of the neighbour images will be
        displayed at the bottom where you can navigate to next/previous image.</p>

    <p>At this page we will use Javascript to make our own gallery. </p>

    <p><b>Contact - contact.php</b></p>

    <p>The Contact page will contain information about how to contact the company behind Dwarfheim. It will contain a
        contact form where the user can fill in name, email and the question or comment they want to ask the team. Above
        the contact form, there will be links to the FAQ and The Crew sites. That can help the user to try to find the
        answer on a question without directly contacting the team. If the visitor have talked about to one of the team
        members, the visitor can easily go to The Crew site to get direct contact with that person. The purpose of this
        page is to let the user get in contact with the team in a easy way. </p>

    <p>To make this contact form intuitive we will use basic input fields where we specify what the input field will
        contain to be verified. Name-field will be just regular text, email will be an email-input field and the
        commentary-field will be a textarea-field. All the input fields will be underneath each other. </p>

    <p>This page will use Javascript to gather and send the information from the contact form to the team. </p>

    <p><b>FAQ - faq.php</b></p>

    <p>The FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page is useful for answering questions that visitors often wonder about.
        This page will contain the most frequently asked question to help the visitors find answers on the questions
        they are asking themselves. It’s really important that this page is easy to understand and intuitive. Each
        question will be in a box with an arrow on the left side to indicate that you can click on the box. When the box
        is clicked, the answer will appear underneath the question. In this way we can have a lot of questions without
        taking up a lot of space on the site, This makes it easier for the visitors to find the question they are
        looking for. </p>

    <p>The box with the question will be in a light gray color with rounded corners. The arrow or triangle will be in a
        orange color to represent the design of Dwarfheim and the appearing box with the question will have a white
        background color to make it easy to read. </p>

    <p>We will use Javascript to hide and show the answer underneath the question. </p>

    <p><b>Investors - investors.php</b></p>

    <p>When possible investors and other potential collaborators visit the site, they will find relevant information
        here. This will feature business related information, and technical notes. This site will comprise three parts.
        The first part will be professional information about the team, company structure, and history. Below that there
        will be a section dedicated to presenting the business plan and related information. At the bottom users will
        find a contact form for contacting the company about business related inquiries. This contact form will be the

    <p><b>The Crew - about.php</b></p>

        designers, testers and marketers. The page will also contain an overview of all the members of the team, and
        what role they have. The representation of each and every crew member, is a picture of themselves, and their
        personal email and phone number, such that visitors easy can access a member’s contact info. If the visitor
        wants more information about a crew member, he/she can click the “more info”- link below, and it will guide the
